## [Description](#table-of-contents)
My project is a README generator. The project will help a user generate a README without having to worry about applying proper mark down syntax.
This README generator will allow the user to answer a series of specific questions and create a professional complete README based on their responses. It will take a couple minutes and provide the developer with the ability to make their project complete and more professional, increasing the likely hood that someone will want to use their app over similar apps without a README.

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
Click the repository link below. Download the zip file and copy it to a directory of your choice or clone to a directory of your choice using your terminal. Open the file in VS Code or whatever editor you work with. Open the terminal in VS Code and make sure you’re in the root directory,You’ll now be ready to run the app!

Tutorial on how to use app 

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
After installation is complete, run the following code: ‘node index.js’ in the terminal. Answer the prompts and after completion, you should see a console log showing your answers to your prompts, a message that says ‘File created!’, and you should see your filegenerate-ReadMe.md
